            <h3>JavaScript</h3>
            <p>JavaScript (JS) is a powerful, high-level programming language that is one of the core technologies of the web, alongside HTML and CSS. It enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. Any action or behavior you see on a webpage—be it dynamic content updates, animated graphics, interactive maps, or video jukeboxes—is likely powered by JavaScript. Initially designed to run in the browser, it has now expanded its reach to server-side development through Node.js. JavaScript follows the ECMAScript specification and supports object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g., functional programming) styles, making it a versatile and widely used language in web development.</p>

            <h3>Python</h3>
            <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its clear syntax and readability, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced developers alike. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python's comprehensive standard library, combined with its ability to integrate with other languages and technologies, makes it incredibly versatile for a wide range of applications—from web development with frameworks like Django and Flask, to data analysis and machine learning with libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn. Its simplicity and power have contributed to Python becoming one of the most popular programming languages in the world, widely used in scientific computing, AI, web development, automation, and more.</p>

            <h3>SQL</h3>
            <p>SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases. It allows users to query data, update records, and manage database structures efficiently. SQL operates through simple, yet powerful, commands such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and CREATE TABLE, enabling the execution of complex queries, data aggregation, and transaction control. SQL's wide adoption is due to its ability to work with vast amounts of data across different database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and SQLite. Its capability to maintain data integrity, support for ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, and role in business intelligence and data analysis make SQL indispensable in data-driven environments. Through SQL, users can gain insights, generate reports, and support decision-making processes in various applications, from web development to financial analysis.</p>
